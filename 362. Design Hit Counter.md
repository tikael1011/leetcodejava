Design a hit counter which counts the number of hits received in the past 5 minutes.

Each function accepts a timestamp parameter (in seconds granularity) and you may assume that calls are being made to the system in chronological order (ie, the timestamp is monotonically increasing). You may assume that the earliest timestamp starts at 1.

It is possible that several hits arrive roughly at the same time.

Example:
HitCounter counter = new HitCounter();

// hit at timestamp 1.
counter.hit(1);

// hit at timestamp 2.
counter.hit(2);

// hit at timestamp 3.
counter.hit(3);

// get hits at timestamp 4, should return 3.
counter.getHits(4);

// hit at timestamp 300.
counter.hit(300);

// get hits at timestamp 300, should return 4.
counter.getHits(300);

// get hits at timestamp 301, should return 3.
counter.getHits(301); 
Follow up:
What if the number of hits per second could be very large? Does your design scale?

This is a good design problem,based on needs, (scale,thread safe...) we may end up with different solution.

The most intuitive one is Queue:

```java
public class HitCounter {
        Queue<Integer> q = null;
        /** Initialize your data structure here. */
        public HitCounter() {
            q = new LinkedList<Integer>();
        }
        
        /** Record a hit.
            @param timestamp - The current timestamp (in seconds granularity). */
        public void hit(int timestamp) {
            q.offer(timestamp);
        }
        
        /** Return the number of hits in the past 5 minutes.
            @param timestamp - The current timestamp (in seconds granularity). */
        public int getHits(int timestamp) {
            while(!q.isEmpty() && timestamp - q.peek() >= 300) {
                q.poll();
            }
            return q.size();
        }
    }
```
But the sc is literally O(number of hits), say we have 1m hits at timestamp(1), then the queue will contain 1m of '1'.

The second thought is using a bucket, of which size is 300.

```java
public class HitCounter {
    private int[] times;
    private int[] hits;
    /** Initialize your data structure here. */
    public HitCounter() {
        times = new int[300];
        hits = new int[300];
    }
    
    /** Record a hit.
        @param timestamp - The current timestamp (in seconds granularity). */
    public void hit(int timestamp) {
        int index = timestamp % 300;
        if (times[index] != timestamp) {
            times[index] = timestamp;
            hits[index] = 1;
        } else {
            hits[index]++;
        }
    }
    
    /** Return the number of hits in the past 5 minutes.
        @param timestamp - The current timestamp (in seconds granularity). */
    public int getHits(int timestamp) {
        int total = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < 300; i++) {
            if (timestamp - times[i] < 300) {
                total += hits[i];
            }
        }
        return total;
    }
}
```
The above solution has O(1) sc, O(1) hit() and O(300)(which is also O(1) in theory) gethits().But it will have concurrency problem, even if AtomicIntegerArray is used. (we can creat a pair class (2D array)or use tuple in python to avoid two arrays). There are different variants (pre-sum, linkedlist, deque, etc) but still they have the concurrency problem.

Another thought is creating a removal/gc/circular array mechanism. Still we need to solve concurrency problem, by locking.IMHO, reentrantlock is good enough though.
