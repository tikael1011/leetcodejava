Given a string, determine if a permutation of the string could form a palindrome.

For example,
"code" -> False, "aab" -> True, "carerac" -> True.

//There is one flaw in the above link, the algorithm is right though.

//I will prefer the array method or Pyhthon counter method,
//hashmap/hashset is kinda redundant, since we do not care about the O(1) lookup time.
