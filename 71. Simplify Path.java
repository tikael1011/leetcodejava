Given an absolute path for a file (Unix-style), simplify it.

For example,
path = "/home/", => "/home"
path = "/a/./b/../../c/", => "/c"
click to show corner cases.

Corner Cases:
Did you consider the case where path = "/../"?
In this case, you should return "/".
Another corner case is the path might contain multiple slashes '/' together, such as "/home//foo/".
In this case, you should ignore redundant slashes and return "/home/foo".

//the idea can be easily seen from the code, STACK, just do not forget to deal with some corner case.

class Solution(object):
    def simplifyPath(self, path):
        places = [p for p in path.split("/") if p!="." and p!=""]
        stack = []
        for p in places:
            if p == "..":
                if len(stack) > 0:
                    stack.pop()
            else:
                stack.append(p)
        return "/" + "/".join(stack)
