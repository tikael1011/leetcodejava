[i] == important

[d] == design involved

[e] == extra info/knowledge in comments

[p] == there is(are) problem(s) left



[r] == extra testing/proof requested, tbc

[er] == IMHO, easier than the indicated difficulty

[hr] == IMHO, harder than the indicated difficulty


Planning to group by problem type/methods, like math, DP, DFS, Bit manipulation, Sorting.
But there is a problem that one problem may contain multi labels. But at least the difficulty does not matter that much.

I bought leetcode subscription and that's why I have access to the locked questions, yet I will not make them public.
