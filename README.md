[i] == important

[p] == there is(are) problem(s) left

[e] == extra info/knowledge in comments

[er] == IMHO, easier than the indicated difficulty

[hr] == IMHO, harder than the indicated difficulty

Planning to group by problem type/methods, like math, DP, DFS, Bit manipulation, Sorting.
But there is a problem that one problem may contain multi labels and I want them only appear one.
