/*
Given an integer n, return the number of trailing zeroes in n!.

Note: Your solution should be in logarithmic time complexity.

// this problem has nothing to do with the binary search, the rc requirement looks familiar though.

//recursive way:

return n == 0 ? 0 : n / 5 + trailingZeroes(n / 5);

//iterative way

    public int trailingZeroes(int n) {
        int cnt = 0;
