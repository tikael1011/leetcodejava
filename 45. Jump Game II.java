/*
Given an array of non-negative integers, you are initially positioned at the first index of the array.

Each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position.

Your goal is to reach the last index in the minimum number of jumps.

For example:
Given array A = [2,3,1,1,4]

The minimum number of jumps to reach the last index is 2. (Jump 1 step from index 0 to 1, then 3 steps to the last index.)

Note:
You can assume that you can always reach the last index.

*/

//as mentioned, the array is NON-negative int, so regardless note, there is always at least one path/solution.
//The problem is kinda like to find a path in unweighted graph/tree

class Solution {
    public int jump(int[] A) {
        int jumps = 0, curEnd = 0, curFarthest = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < A.length - 1; i++) {
            curFarthest = Math.max(curFarthest, i + A[i]);
            if (i == curEnd) {
                jumps++;
                curEnd = curFarthest;

                if (curEnd >= A.length - 1) {
                    break;
                }
            }
        }
        return jumps;
    }
