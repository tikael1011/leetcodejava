/*
Given a binary array, find the maximum length of a contiguous subarray with equal number of 0 and 1.

Example 1:
Input: [0,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: [0, 1] is the longest contiguous subarray with equal number of 0 and 1.
Example 2:
Input: [0,1,0]
Output: 2
Explanation: [0, 1] (or [1, 0]) is a longest contiguous subarray with equal number of 0 and 1.

//the idea is to maintain pre-sum (count in this problem) and then use a hashmap search same count, thus find the index
//we can avoid use hashmap, but search in hashmap is O(1), so why not?
