Since this problem can be extend to K- vectors, so a more generalized solution is better.

solution 1: everytime next() is called, if 'list2' hasnext(), switch list1 and list2. otherwise keep iterate list1.

solution 2: Uses a queue to store the iterators in different vectors. Every time we call next(), we pop an element from the list, and re-add it to the end to cycle through the lists.
