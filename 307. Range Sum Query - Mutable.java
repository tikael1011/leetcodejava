/*
Given an integer array nums, find the sum of the elements between indices i and j (i ≤ j), inclusive.

The update(i, val) function modifies nums by updating the element at index i to val.
Example:
Given nums = [1, 3, 5]

sumRange(0, 2) -> 9
update(1, 2)
sumRange(0, 2) -> 8
Note:
The array is only modifiable by the update function.
You may assume the number of calls to update and sumRange function is distributed evenly.
