/*
Given a 2d grid map of '1's (land) and '0's (water), count the number of islands. An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.

Example 1:

11110
11010
11000
00000
Answer: 1

Example 2:

11000
11000
00100
00011

//This question is about DFS and better use a helper function, otherwise, keep track of i,j in a nested for loop will be
//pain ***.

/*
Python, this solution is NOT optimal, especially something like:
01010101
10101010
01010101
10101010

every time map() is invoked, it made duplicate scan on previous cells.

def numIslands(self, grid):
    def sink(i, j):
        if 0 <= i < len(grid) and 0 <= j < len(grid[i]) and grid[i][j] == '1':

            map(sink, (i+1, i-1, i, i), (j, j, j+1, j-1))
            return 1
        return 0
    return sum(sink(i, j) for i in range(len(grid)) for j in range(len(grid[i])))

//The java solution alters the input, we can creat a 2d matrix = input grid, but this will cost extra space,
// since take the stack space into considersation ,it is already O(n), does not matter that much. is it?
// The rc is O(mn), where m & n are the length of row & cloumn.
