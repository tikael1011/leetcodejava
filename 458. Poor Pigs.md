https://leetcode.com/problems/poor-pigs/description/

This is a math problem.

total attempts = floor(minutesToTest/minutesToDie)
so we need attempts+1 to do the encoding.
also we can imagine a N dim space, where 5^N <= buckets, (we have four attempts total)


```java
public int poorPigs(int buckets, int minutesToDie, int minutesToTest) {
    int status = minutesToTest/minutesToDie + 1;
    int num_of_pig = 0;
    while(Math.pow(status, num_of_pig) < buckets) {
        num_of_pig++;
    }
    return num_of_pig;
}
```
